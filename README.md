## About this repository
This is my personal archive of creative coding works.  
Each sketch lives in its own folder inside `/sketches`, with:
- `sketch.js` â€” the source code
- `meta.json` â€” metadata (title, date, tools, tags, description)
- `preview.png` or `preview.gif` â€” a visual preview
- `export/` â€” optional rendered frames or videos

The repository also includes:
- `/site` â€” GitHub Pages static gallery
- `/scripts` â€” automation tools (e.g., gallery generator)
